done

Updating a bounty:

Open bounties.dat file
search by the title of the bounty that you are looking for
Once found, store in memory
store the rest of the bounty in memory (hint: use index++ on each loop iteration, stop at index=6ish)
store original title under $titleOld
Present the form with values filled in, prompting user to change them
If user submits an updated bounty, delete the old bounty (search for it with $titleOld) using delete algorithm

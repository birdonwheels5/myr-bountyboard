Algorithms

Removing a bounty:

Open bounties.dat file

Once found, set to ""

done

Updating a bounty:

Open bounties.dat file
search by the title of the bounty that you are looking for
Once found, store in memory under the appropriate variable name and set to "*#*"
store in memory the next 5 lines and set to "*#*" (hint: use index++ on each loop iteration, stop at index=6ish)
store original title under $titleOld
Present the form with values filled in, prompting user to change them
If user submits an updated bounty, delete the old bounty using delete algorithm

Notes:

DONE *Add "Active" flag
FIXED *Updating a bounty will cause it to drop to the bottom of the bounty list
FIXED *Pressing the enter key in any field will cause any data after the keystroke to be lost.
*Make a search current bounties function, for use in the bunty submit, bounty delete, and bunty update forms.
*Make the new bounty form show the error messages at the bottom. (use int codes to hide/show the messages!) // What? I don't remember why I wrote this. For if a title is not found?
